      <h1> Human-Vehicle Cooperation on Prediction-Level</h1>
      <p>
        It seems that autonomous driving systems are substituting human responsibilities in the driving task. 
        However, this does not mean that vehicles should not interact with their driver anymore, even in case of full automation. 
        One reason is that the automation is not yet advanced enough to predict other road user's behavior in complex situations, which can lead to sub-optimal action choices, decrease comfort and user experience. 
        In contrast, a human driver may have a more reliable understanding of other road users' intentions which could complement that of the automation. 
        We implement an approach that lets a human driver quickly and intuitively supplement scene predictions to an autonomous driving system by gaze.
