    <p>
      The road environment can be seen as a social situation and road user safety can be viewed as not just skills-based and rule-governed. Numerous studies show that intentional driving violations make an independent significant contribution to traffic accident involvement.
      <br>
      <br>
      We propose a concept based on Driver to Driver communication and social network, which enables road users to express their anger and appreciation to othersâ€™ driving behaviour. Investigation on how drivers feel about receiving feedback of evaluating their driving behavior from other drivers was conducted. The results show that such evaluation has a positive influence on reducing driving violations.
