    <p>The HUD-AR (Augmented Reality for head-up-display) is an affordable device for enhancing social communication between drivers and add more fun to the journey without distracting driving task.
      Drivers need to coordinate with each other to share the road infrastructure and the social relationship between drivers also influences the driving behavior. However, when we sit in our “iron cages”, there are only a few channels to deliver information on the road. Cars appear as machines, lacking any human-like features. This lack has also been shown to contribute towards selfish behavior, misunderstanding and social isolation on the road.
      <br>
      The HUD-AR utilizes the camera of a smartphone and image recognition algorithms to recognize other cars’ identity, then social information is transferred between drivers and presented in an augmented reality way. The hardware part of HUD-AR was designed with attention to details and realized with different techniques such as modeling, laser cutting and painting. The software part has been tested and validated for several versions. The prototype was tested in real life settings and was proved to be robust.
